# Part-of-Speech-tagging

In this project, I use the Pomegranate library to build a **hidden Markov model** for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset. I achieved a >96% tag accuracy with larger tagsets on realistic text corpora. This project includes three steps.

1 Process raw texts.
2 Build a Most Frequent Class tagger to use as a baseline.
3 Build an HMM Part of Speech tagger and compare to the MFC baseline. 

All codes are stored in the jupyter notebook.
